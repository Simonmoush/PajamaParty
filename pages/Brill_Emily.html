I don't want to become the world's
				</p>
				<hr style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">
				<p>
In blond girls I always sense depression 
I want to protect them
I dye my hair blond
				</p>
				<hr style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">

The song of the air is the song of something else
Here
I am not the air's child,
the water
laps at me, takes possession,
though I say, "stop,"
There is a tiny me in my inner ear
And she is all wet
				</p>
				<hr style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">
				<p>
I'm just like talking about some stuff
Here on the Train
Industrial yards and junk trucks the backdrop to my beautiful epiphanies
				</p>
				<hr style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">
				<h1>Dispatches from the creek</h1>
				<h2>I</h2>
				<p>
In Germany the train passes graffiti on a boxcar spelling my last name
Loops and curlicues --
In English, "glasses"
				</p>
				<h2>II</h2>
				<p>
On Paul Robeson Avenue I think
Man, if I had known all you needed to get into this school was a field hockey career
Then I shake my hips around
I dislodge the thought but cannot locate it
It is somewhere in the night in Germany
				</p>
				<hr style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">
				<p>
Is consciousness really all up in the head because when my center pulses
with jellyfish it does no good to ignore it

Abstrusity from the highest mountain 
A building falling apart in place
No red tape, no red squiggle lines
Someone paints everything pink with a bottle
While nothing will be said of birthright,
You can call these places home
				</p>
				<hr style="width: 50%; margin: auto;">
				<p>
I look at you and you are like the great idiot of my life and I love you
