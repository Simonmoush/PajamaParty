				<h1>skinny dipping under the supermoon (pale and brave)</h1>
				<p>
the water was dark
	and up to my chest
the sky was dark, dripping starlight
there were no sounds until
our skin hit the river
like white rocks past midnight
glowing in the moonlight
from behind the trees

the water pressure on my ribcage
a hug a crush
amplifying my heartbeat
while it poetically annihilated my bone structure
under the guise of-
THIS IS WHY THEY CALL THEM CRUSHES

your body in the moonlight
pale and brave
was composed entirely of places i
had not yet kissed.

the water was dark
	and up to my chest
your hand was warm in mine
your arms were strong
and the moon was so bright
				</p>

				<h1>(3/365)</h1>
				<p>
i would rearrange all my furniture for you
i would give away everything i own on kijji
i would make a woodpile of all the bed frames and bookshelves
dragging sofas across the
hardwood by myself
to prove to you that there is
room enough for you
to call this place home
for you to fill every inch
of this house with your heart

DO YOU BELIEVE ME NOW
i would shout 		riding the mattress down the stairs
the sound echoing through rooms
empty like my arms outstretched
open, hopeful
do you believe me now?
				</p>

				<h1>the things we leave behind us</h1>
				<p>
my gran's aloe vera plant
sprawling juicy green
soothed 7 separate sunburns
the summer i was 17

her life was shipped box
by box
to rural ontario
but my gran's life cracked during the move
(not packed tight enough)

a few things here and there
left to rattle around in her empty
apartment like loose change
in a pants pocket

the giant aloe vera plant stuck
out in the hallway of the condominium
with the hope that someone would take it
home to continue spilling out of its pot

i lose track
i don't go back
no last glances before the realtor takes the keys

a month later i buy a tiny aloe vera plant
this is a delicate cycle
an adjacent laundry room
life is generations of red-haired women
starting from tiny plants
and stretching toward the sun.
