I hate this writing I hate these empty words i spew out at parties
where I never know where to place myself and I haven’t been 
bright in these settings in a while and it isn’t me and is this how 
we are expected to be and me in February is neglectful and disconnected 

feeling both apprehensive abt beginning new things and 
desirous but what else is new this framework doesn’t destroy that 
it doesn’t break dependencies and insecurities 

maybe not myself but this at least gives a place for my eyes 

when did I get so worried abt our eyes 

i’m trying to occupy realms i’ve never seen that isn’t tru i’m not 
trying to occupy anything i’m floating i’m waiting to transform 
your fear your hatred your rejection into my power so i can come 
back and float away from this river but not away from the river 
the river will grow until it’s all river and i’m floating through all of it 
but i’m feeling the patriarchal bullshit 
i’m feeling the norm of providing and securing 
learn to allow people to ache and know there is nothing to do 
i don’t hold everyone’s answers 
i don’t know how to talk to people when they have a question 
that i can’t shine my fucking light on 

i’ve become dislodged unanchored feeling adrift 

back w/ that unproductive and empty feeling i need to pee i need 
to think about active listening i need to revisit why i’m here i 
need to understand where i’m going or what direction i should 
even start in i’m so worried abt destroying my family, destroying 
myself, destroying everyone around me
