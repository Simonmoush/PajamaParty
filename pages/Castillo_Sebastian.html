				<h1>READER’S DIGEST</h1>
				<p>
My mother always
told me to fumigate
the soft, tawdry remains
of indie rock’s authenticity,
but I never listened to Mom.
Now I’m in a band
and miserable. But even that’s
a lie. I’m not in a band.
I just read websites.
And make money for a living.

				<h1>SAD MOVIE SPEC (after J.A.)</h1>
				<h2>ACT I:</h2>
				<p>
He was a lazy father who made
documentary films. “I hope you never 
have to do anything for money,” 
he said to his children. “I have a one-man
show coming up next month,” he said.
				</p>
				<h2>ACT II:</h2>
				<p>
Three people buy a dog and laugh
with it on their way home.
				</p>
				<h2>ACT III:</h2>
				<p>
If you learn anything in life,
then you’ve been lied to.
Said the tree.

<i>(Camera should zoom in on children’s mouths, brows.)</i>

				<h1>20 UNUSUAL DEATHS</h1>
				<p>
He kissed his moonlight reflection on the river, and drowned.

He was covered in shit, eaten alive by dogs.

He gorged on mercury.

He roasted alive on a grill. “Turn me over,” he said, “I’m done on this side.”

He had a horn pushed into his anus.

He was sewn into his bed.

He held his urine at the dinner table.

He laughed.

He ate a 14-course dinner.

He was punched in the stomach.

He was there when his equipment broke.

He was hit by a stray fire extinguisher.

He wouldn’t eat anything that wasn’t cooked by his wife.

He walked into a helicopter.

He stood too close to cacti.

He exploded.

He was wrong about the glass.

He was trampled by hay.

He was impaled by a statue.

He was cooking something that was still alive.
