Is david perez son of noe grandson of abraham going to read some poetry for us tonight
He shimmies onto the dancefloor like a baby fish and adjusts his glasses pulling a rolled up flour tortilla from the pocket of his huipil and takes a few bites of it which are chewed with his mouth open accompanied by absoft sound
The hot sauce he spilled on that huipil i think its blood from his heart soaking through his skin and the fabric but when i smell it i know its not blood and i can only paint him as a boy martyr saint in a fictional work and in real life he cannot do that
Why are you wearing your mom's huipil david and why did you sew a pocket onto it i want to ask because neither of us is sure if that particular element is really from a fictional dimension just hiding itself in our realities to play a trick on us he listens to bachata mixes on youtube for like 2 hours
he will take a few more bites of the tortiloa over the ourse of the night
Abuela es automovil rapido
Abuelas es fuerza del viento
Don't believe me?
Talk to my tiny hands broken heart my son when he sits at his desk he places his braid inside of an urn that is there for as long as it takes for itto be completely soaked in ink he walks around whipping the braid dripping the ink like rain everything in our house is stained i want to let him outside but i never do because we're not allowed to stain the earth with ink only with blood

Just when I was thinking "¿Wow, could it be that you hate me?"
I hear you dribbling a basketball outside
sitting here on the floor, I wonder what that might look like considering every inch of the back yard is covered in grass But I don't need to get up and look because its more fun just to listen to and think about
How can one preemptively heal a wound?
Simply don't expect to ever be wounded
When I first started working in retail they made us watch a video during the training process
It showed an adult saying "there are two kinds of people in this world"
the adult paused, adjusted belt tightness by another notch, and continued
"observe,"
that person, in the uniform of the department store that had employed me approached another and pointed to a dog laying nearby saying,
"hey, look at that animal."
the other person replied "haven't you ever seen a dog before? why would you say that?"
The scene closed and another one began with the same opening shot as the first
again the person said "hey look at that animal," pointing to the dog laying nearby
this time the person was different
it was you, smiling and saying "yes, I like that animal. ¿Do you think it would mind if we got a little closer to it?"
If you do happen to get wounded, simply tend to it in the appropriate manner and move along. Make sure you do it well though, so as to never be slowed down by the same wound more than once (twice, or more)
The first thing you ever said was a prayer. Not long after that, you said to me telepathically "¿who invented all of this stuff?"
I looked at you, still very small and round, holding onto your foot and I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do it, but through my eyes I passed to you some of the heaviness that was pulling my heart down to my stomach when I heard you ask that.
I would hover above you, lamenting the distance between us but I was also right below you, wrapped around you and in your heart. I'm glad you noticed me there sometimes, because some of the people I visit go their whole lives without ever knowing I was there.
