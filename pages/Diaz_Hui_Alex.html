				<h1>Our Distinctive Appearances</h1>
				<p>
	<i>after Taylor Swift’s “Style”</i>

The time is currently 12:00 am, and you are arriving to take me somewhere
Your car has no lights to see the road in which we are driving on.
We take quite a long drive, which could either end in hellish flames or a heavenly experience.
I am suddenly able to view, but it has been several hours since I have had any correspondence with 
you
I believe that I have to tell you to leave due to the fact that I
Am completely aware as to what this situation will end in, but however I
Will always view us going around in circles every time.

You currently have an appearance that looks like you’re a daydream of James Dean in your eyes
And I currently have a red pigment on my lips, which is a classic look that you enjoy.
And at the point when we are making a destructive impact downwards
We will always pick ourselves back up again
Due to the fact that we will never lose our distinctive appearances
We will never lose our distinct appearances  

Your haircut is long, with your hair moved backwards with hair product as well as a white 
t-shirt
And I currently have faith similar to the Virgin Mary, as well as a small skirt that is constricted to my 
body
And at the point when we are making a destructive impact downwards
We will always pick ourselves back up again
Due to the fact that we will never lose our distinctive appearances
We will never lose our distinct appearances  

So this is what is currently happening:
The man I am with is unable to keep is insane eyes off of the pathway in which cars drive on
He takes his automobile to my house
The lights in my house are not on, and he is removing his outside article of clothing
I then declare that I was told that you have been doing many different activities
with some other person who identifies as female
He then replies, I must say that what you have been told is correct, however
I am unable to cease my thoughts about you and I
I reply I have also had similar thoughts

Because you currently have an appearance that looks like a daydream of James Dean in your eyes
And I currently have a red pigment on my lips, which is a classic look that you enjoy.
And at the point when we are making a destructive impact downwards
We will always pick ourselves back up again
Due to the fact that we will never lose our distinctive appearances
We will never lose our distinct appearances  

Your haircut is long, with your hair moved backwards with hair product as well as a white 
t-shirt
And I currently have faith similar to the Virgin Mary, as well as a small skirt that is constricted to my 
body
And at the point when we are making a destructive impact downwards
We will always pick ourselves back up again
Due to the fact that we will never lose our distinctive appearances
We will never lose our distinct appearances  

I request that you take my home
Nothing more, my request is for you to take me home
Nothing more, my request is for you to take me home

You currently have an appearance that looks like a daydream of James Dean in your eyes
And I currently have a red pigment on my lips, which is a classic look that you enjoy.
And at the point when we are making a destructive impact downwards
We will always pick ourselves back up again
Due to the fact that we will never lose our distinctive appearances
We will never lose our distinct appearances
